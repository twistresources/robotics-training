## About these courses

As the decades go by, computing is taking a more physical day-to-day role in everybody's life. Forty years ago a computer was a machine used in an business or research environment, accessed using a Terminal.
With the advent of PCs we got computing power in our households, but still software was almost _conceptual_ - just data and algorithms (and games) hidden behind the words on the green screen.

The Internet gave us unlimited access to applications, communications and information (and social media).

Mobile devices and 5G networks have given us that functionality on the go, but predominantly it has been functionality _hidden behind a screen_.

In the coming years we believe computing will transition out from behind the screens, and into everyday life.

The courses we include in this repository our our best guess at the direction technology will progress, based on what is now available:

- Artificial Intelligence will make interacting with computers more natural - like Siri/Alexa/Google voice on steroids. It will also result in more "intelligent" responses and communication methods.
- Robotics is already having a huge impact on manufacturing, and driven by AI is likely to transition from being used for specific tasks to more generic environments, including homes.
- The "Internet Of Things" involves devices, from household appliances, to industrial monitoring, benefitting from Internet connectivity.

Some of these technologies, and specifically AI, will require massive capitalisation to develop and be the realm of Google, Meta, Amazon and Apple, but there will always be opportunities for regular people and IT people to apply these new technologies into the economy.

These courses are intended to give our employees a glimpse into, and understanding of the future.
